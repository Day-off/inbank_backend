## Some notes
### Functionality that has been implemented

- Checking if customer can get requested loan (no debt)
- Checking if the bank can provide the requested loan
- If not, there is a recalculation of the loan amount or period that the bank can offer the client

### Experience

- I have experience with the back end, so there was nothing difficult except figuring out how to hard code the data in a decent way, normally I'm used to working with databases and repositories.
