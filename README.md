## Some notes
### Functionality that has been implemented

- Checking whether the customer can get
- Checking if the bank can provide the requested loan
- If unsuccessful, there is a recalculation of the loan amount or period that the bank can offer the client

### Experience

- The most difficult part on the back for me was the parsing of the xml response, because I had never worked with this type of language before.
